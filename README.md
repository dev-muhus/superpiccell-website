# Super Piccell Website Project

This project is a website for the Super Piccell project, built using Next.js and Docker, with Contentful for content management. It is designed to be flexible and reusable for other projects by simply updating the environment variables.

## Project Structure

- **frontend**: The Next.js frontend application.
- **backend**: Placeholder for future backend services.

---

## Frontend

The frontend of this project is built with Next.js. The setup is containerized with Docker and uses Contentful for CMS integration.

### Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following:

- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Contentful account with API tokens (Space ID, Access Token, etc.)
- Alchemy account for blockchain API integration (API Key required)
- Configured environment variables (`.env.local`)

---

## How to Reuse

To reuse this project for other purposes, update the environment variables in `.env.local` to match your new projectâ€™s requirements. Adjustments can include:

- Blockchain configuration (e.g., contract address, network details)
- Contentful content type IDs
- Alchemy network settings

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd superpiccell-website
   ```

2. **Configure environment variables**:

   - At the project root, create a `.env` file with the following content:
     ```
     PORT=3000
     ```

   - In the `frontend` directory, ensure a `.env.local` file is present with the following variables:
     ```

   ```
   docker compose exec frontend bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the development server**:

   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

   Access the application at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
